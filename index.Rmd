## Example Graph

Here's the sort of graph that the app displays. This is the average grade given in the CS department at Dartmouth, by year.  

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data <- read.csv("DeptData.csv")
data <- subset(data,Department == "COSC")
ggplot(data, aes_string(x="Year", y="grade")) + geom_line(color = "darkgrey") + 
                        geom_point(colour = "darkgreen", size = 5) + 
                        geom_text(aes_string(label="grade"), vjust=-2) + 
                        scale_x_continuous(breaks=unique(data$Year)) +
                        theme_bw()

```
